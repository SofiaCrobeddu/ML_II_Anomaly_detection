## PURPOSE

The aim of this project was to implement a ***LSTM autoencoder*** model for ***Anomaly detection***. The programming language used is Python.
The dataset used is taken from Gecco challenge 2018 at the following link: https://www.spotseven.de/gecco/gecco-challenge/gecco-challenge-2018/.

## REPOSITORIES

The repositories and the files are:
- **ResourcePackage2018/ResourcePackage**: it contains the code and other files belonging to the repository of the official website of Gecco challenge 2018. The file with data is `waterDataTraining.RDS`.
- `Anomaly detection.ipynb`: contains the code for the implementation of the model. It was also performed a preliminary pre-processing and the exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `Machine_Learning_II___Anomaly_Detection_project.pdf`: contains the report with the interpretation and the explanations of the results.
